## This is a repository for coursework on Robotics technology.
### The goal of this course was to provide challenging problems to those interested in developing advanced theoretical and practical knowledge in robotics.

### Learning outcomes
* have applied the theoretical ideas of state machines in a practical context for solving complex tasks;
* have controlled numerous (mobile) robotics platforms;
* have applied image processing algorithms for solving real-time problems;
* have implemented a control algorithm for balancing a robot;
* be familiar with the simultaneous localisation and mapping class of problems;
* be familiar with the concepts of forward and inverse kinematics;
* have practised discussing field-specific topics with other course participants.
